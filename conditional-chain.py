"""
LCEL Conditional Chain — Context Sufficiency Check
===================================================
Implements a conditional branching pipeline using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).

Flow:
  User message (with optional context)
    → [Context Checker Chain]  — decides: "sufficient" | "insufficient"
    → [LCEL Branch]            — routes based on context availability
        ├── sufficient   → [Answer Chain]   — responds based on provided context
        └── insufficient → [Follow-up Chain] — asks clarifying questions

Concepts demonstrated:
  - Chain composition with the | operator
  - RunnableLambda for custom routing logic
  - RunnableBranch for conditional branching (True / False paths)
  - RunnablePassthrough.assign to enrich the input dict mid-pipeline
